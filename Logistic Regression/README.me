run.sh will run two versions of logistic regression on the data in this repo. The first will use the MAP objective function/gradient.
The train/test prediction errors will be printed for prior variance values 0.01, 0.1, 0.5, 1, 3, 5, 10, 100.
The second version will use the MLE objective function/gradient and will simply print out the train/test prediction errors.
