run.sh will learn decision trees using information gain, majority error, and gini index as well as vary tree depths
The code will learn trees against 3 data sets
Cars - learns trees depth 1-6 and outputs test and training errors
Bank (no replacement) - learns trees depth 1-16 and outputs test and training errors, treats unknown as a unique value
Bank (majority replacement) - learns trees depth 1-16 and outputs test and training errors, treats unknown as missing and fills in with average value
