run.sh will run two versions of a 4 layer neural network with widths from [5,10,25,50,100]: 
initializing the edge weights with random numbers generated from the standard Gaussian distribution, initializing the edge weights to zero 

It will print out the type of neural network followed by the width then the prediction error for the train and test data.
