Based on input, run.sh will either run AdaBoost, BaggedTrees, or RandomForests to learn models and output their accuracy over 500 values of T. 
If no input is specified no files are run. The models are learned using the bank data included in this repository. For random forests and 
bagged trees after finshing learning the model and printing the test and train accuracy it will print the bias/var for single tree learners vs bagged/random learners

./run.sh 0 - eo_AdaBoost.py
./run.sh 1 - eo_BaggedTrees.py
./run.sh 2 - eo_RandomForests.py
